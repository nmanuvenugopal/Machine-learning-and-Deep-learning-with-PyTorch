Machine learning and Deep learning with PyTorch

## Basic question one should ask yourself is when should we use Machine Learning and Deep Learning ?
1. When we have long list of rules. for example, self driving cars.
2. Continually changing environment. for example, deep learning and machine learning model can be well introduced to new scenarios or unseen data or pattern.
3. When we have large dataset -  both machine learning and deep learning can be used to train on large dataset to discover the insights.
