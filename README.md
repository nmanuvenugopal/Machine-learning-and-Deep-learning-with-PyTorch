Machine learning and Deep learning with PyTorch

## Basic question one should ask yourself is when should we use Machine Learning and Deep Learning ?
1. When we have long list of rules. for example, self driving cars.
2. Continually changing environment. for example, deep learning and machine learning model can be well introduced to new scenarios or unseen data or pattern.
3. When we have large dataset -  both machine learning and deep learning can be used to train on large dataset to discover the insights.

## Now next question will be when should we avoid using Machine Learning and Deep Learning ?
1. When we need explainalibity meaning deep learning in particular are trained with many nueron or units and the patttern learned by these model are typically uninterpretted by humans since they will convert every thing into numbers or vectors of numbers.
2. When the traditional approach is better option we should avoid using ML or deep learning solutions. In other words if we can accomplish what we need by make use of traditional approach then we should make use of traditional approach and avoid ML or deep learning solution.
3. When we do not have much data to train the machine learning or deep learning model.
