Machine learning and Deep learning with PyTorch

## Basic question one should ask yourself is when should we use Machine Learning and Deep Learning ?
1. When we have long list of rules. for example, self driving cars.
2. Continually changing environment. for example, deep learning and machine learning model can be well introduced to new scenarios or unseen data or pattern.
3. When we have large dataset -  both machine learning and deep learning can be used to train on large dataset to discover the insights.

## Now next question will be when should we avoid using Machine Learning and Deep Learning ?
1. When we need explainalibity meaning deep learning in particular are trained with many nueron or units and the patttern learned by these model are typically uninterpretted by humans since they will convert every thing into numbers or vectors of numbers.
2. When the traditional approach is better option we should avoid using ML or deep learning solutions. In other words if we can accomplish what we need by make use of traditional approach then we should make use of traditional approach and avoid ML or deep learning solution.
3. When we do not have much data to train the machine learning or deep learning model.

## So Next question will be what is the difference between Machine learning and deep learning ?
1. Machine learning alogorithm are used when we have a structured data (dataset with features and labels) and the deep learning is used when we have unstructured data such as images, audi and text.
2. Deep learning alogorithm can automatically learn the features directly from the raw data with help of various layers of interconnected nuerons (so this eliminates the feature extraction process) however the machine learning model relies on feature engineering process.
3. Deeping learning model need a substantial amount of data to train with whereas machine learning algorithms need data but do not need that much data as needed by a deep learning model.
4. Regarding the perfomance Machine learning performs well on structured data and it is simple to build and easy to use whereas the deep learning model perform well on much more complex and high diamensional data such as images, audio and text.
5. Typical machine learning model can be run on local system without need of high end GPU and CPU resources however the deep learning models need dedicated tensor processing units (TPUs) and Graphics processing units (GPUs).
